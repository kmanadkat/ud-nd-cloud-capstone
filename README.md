## Event Planner
This is full stack project built on top of React Typescript in Frontend & Node Typescript as Backend. The goal of this project was to create & deploy backend to AWS serverless cloud formation. It is final capstone project of Udacity's Cloud Developer Nanodegree.

### Functionality of Application

It allows creating/fetching/removing Calendar events. Each Event can optionally have an attachment image of venue. User has access to only those calendar events which were created by him/her.

#### Event item

The application stores Events, and each Event contains following field:

- `todoId` (string) - a unique id for an event
- `userId` (string) - a unique id of user who has created event
- `createdAt` (string) - date and time when an event was created
- `title` (string) - name of a Event item (e.g. "Meeting with Chris")
- `description` (string) (optional) - a short description of the event
- `location` (string) - venue of the event
- `start` (Date Time string) - start date & time of the event
- `end` (Date Time string) - end date & time of the event
- `attachmentUrl` (string) (optional) - a URL pointing to an image attached to a Event

You might also store an id of a user who created a TODO item.
